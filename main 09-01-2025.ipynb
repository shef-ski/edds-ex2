Times to 90% first twitch blockade of train-of-four were (mean +/- SEM) 0.82 +/- 0.08 and 1.98 +/- 0.18 min for suxamethonium and atracurium, respectively, compared with times to 90% single twitch blockade of 1.00 +/- 0.07 and 3.35 +/- 0.37 min, respectively (P less than 0.05 in both cases). Apparent onset time also depended on how long train-of-four stimulation had been applied before injection of atracurium. The mode of stimulation had little effect on time to 10% recovery.

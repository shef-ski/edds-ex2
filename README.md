# edds-ex2

### Setup

Ideally use Python 3.12. 

Create a venv folder in the project directory using ``python -m venv venv``. Then, activate the venv using ``venv\Scripts\activate``. Install all libraries using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``. Optional: run ``python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv --display-name="jupyter edds"`` to set a kernel for Jupyter. Then, just enter ``jupyter lab`` in the terminal to launch Jupter lab (make sure to have venv activated and select ``jupyter edds`` in Jupyter).

  - This is the template they require us to use I think. It's quite messy with lots of unnecessary stuff in there.
